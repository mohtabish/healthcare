Healthcare Management System

I developed this system to solve the problem of managing patient records efficiently in Indian healthcare settings.

My Development Decisions
- Used PostgreSQL because of its reliability for medical data
- Chose JWT for security based on industry standards
- Implemented custom validation for Indian phone numbers

Features I Added
- Patient search functionality
- Doctor specialization filtering
- Custom authentication system

Note - If the server does not work on giving "python manage.py runserver" command, try adding /admin/ after the host.
